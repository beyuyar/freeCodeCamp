"""Build an Adjacency List to Matrix Converter
In this lab, you will build a function that converts an adjacency list representation of a graph into an adjacency matrix. An adjacency list is a dictionary where each key represents a node, and the corresponding value is a list of nodes that the key node is connected to. An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where the entry at position [i][j] is 1 if there's an edge from node i to node j, and 0 otherwise.

For example, given the adjacency list:

Example Code
{
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [2],
    2: [0, 3],
    3: [2]
}
The corresponding adjacency matrix would be:

Example Code
[
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0]
]
Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should define a function named adjacency_list_to_matrix to convert an adjacency list to an adjacency matrix.
The function should take a dictionary representing the adjacency list of an unweighted (either undirected or directed) graph as its argument.
The function should:
Convert the adjacency list to an adjacency matrix.
Print each row in the adjacency matrix.
Return the adjacency matrix.
For example, adjacency_list_to_matrix({0: [2], 1: [2, 3], 2: [0, 1, 3], 3: [1, 2]}) should print:

Example Code
[0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 0, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 0]
and return [[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0]].

Tests

Passed: 1. You should define a function named adjacency_list_to_matrix.
Passed: 2. The adjacency_list_to_matrix function should have one parameter.
Passed: 3. The function should correctly determine the number of nodes from the adjacency list.
Passed: 4. The function should correctly set matrix values to 1 for existing edges.
Passed: 5. The function should print each row of the matrix.
Passed: 6. The function should return the adjacency matrix.
Passed: 7. When given the adjacency list {0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [0, 3], 3: [2]}, the function should return [[0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0]].
Passed: 8. When given the adjacency list {0: [1], 1: [0]}, the function should return [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
Passed: 9. When given the adjacency list {0: [], 1: [], 2: []}, the function should return [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]."""
