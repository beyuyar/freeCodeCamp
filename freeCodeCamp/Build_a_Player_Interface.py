"""Build a Player Interface
Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should define an abstract class named Player that inherits from the abc.ABC class.
The Player class should have an __init__ method that sets:

The moves attribute to an empty list.
The position attribute to (0, 0).
The path attribute to a list containing the initial position.
The Player class should have a method named make_move that:

Uses random.choice to get a random move from the moves attribute (defined in the concrete class).
Adds the values from the selected move to the current position and updates the position attribute.
Appends the new position tuple to the path attribute.
Returns the new position.
The Player class should have an abstract method named level_up to be implemented in concrete classes.
You should define a Pawn class that inherits from the Player class.
The Pawn class should use super() to call the parent's __init__ method and then set the moves attribute to a list of tuples representing x, y coordinates.
Each coordinate tuple should represent a movement of 1 unit in the following directions: up, down, left, right.
The Pawn class should implement a concrete level_up method by adding more moves to the moves attribute. The added moves should represent the four diagonal movements (for example, 1 unit down plus 1 unit left).
Note: Standard library modules should be imported without using aliases. Tests related to the Player class will fail until the Pawn class becomes instantiable.

Waiting: 1. You should have a class named Player.
Waiting: 2. The Player class should inherit from the ABC class of the abc module.
Waiting: 3. The Player class should have an __init__ method.
Waiting: 4. The Player's __init__ method should have a single parameter self.
Waiting: 5. The Player's __init__ method should set self.moves to an empty list.
Waiting: 6. The Player's __init__ method should set self.position to (0, 0).
Waiting: 7. The Player's __init__ method should set self.path to a list containing the initial position.
Waiting: 8. The Player class should have a make_move method.
Waiting: 9. The Player's make_move method should have a single parameter self.
Waiting: 10. The Player's make_move method should use random.choice to get a random move from the moves attribute.
Waiting: 11. The Player's make_move method should update the position attribute by adding to it the coordinates of the randomly selected move.
Waiting: 12. The Player's make_move method should append the new position tuple to the path attribute.
Waiting: 13. The Player's make_move method should return the updated position attribute.

Waiting: 20. The Pawn class should have an __init__ method.
Waiting: 21. The Pawn's __init__ method should have a single parameter self.
Waiting: 22. The Pawn's __init__ method should call the parent's __init__ with using the super function.
Waiting: 23. The Pawn's __init__ method should set the moves attribute to a list of tuples representing x, y coordinates, where each coordinate tuple represents a movement of 1 unit in the following directions: up, down, left, right.
